# TITLED WITCH GAME

Trying to get back into game programming, so here's a little demo I'm making based on an idea from my partner. So far, there's nothing more than what you might get out of a basic tutorial and a handlful of free assets, but I'll get something eventually. I won't slap the actual title on this until there's something to be proud of.

## Assets Used

### - Blue Witch Animations

An adorable witch that I got from 9e0 on itch.io, which will do.

### - Overworld Tileset

A simple 16x16 2D tileset from [Davide Pesce's Godot Tutorials](https://www.davidepesce.com/godot-tutorials/), which I highly recommend.
